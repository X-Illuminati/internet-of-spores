# Sensor Electronic Architecture
This outline is currently a work-in-progress.

## Block Diagram
Describe sensor electrical elements (I2C, UART, USB, D1 Mini Stackup, GPIO, Reset, SPI Flash)
- Show I2C Addresses
- Show valid combinations of sensors

## Power Management
- USB/Battery Power
- LiFePO4 Suitability Analysis
- E-Paper Display Power Draw

## Schematic
- Link to Lolin schematics
- Link to Particle Counter datasheet?
- E-Paper Board Schematic

## Bill of Material
- Link to AliExpress for Lolin components
- Link any datasheets
- Link to datasheet for Particle Counter
- Link to datasheet for Waveshare display
- Table of E-Paper Board BOM
